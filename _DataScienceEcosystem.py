# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.

# This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers

# In[10]:


9*7+5


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60

# In[11]:


totalminutes = 200
minutes = 60
hours = totalminutes/minutes
print(hours)
